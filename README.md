# InterviewPrep

I'll be honest in that I hate coding exercises in interviews. There's a lot I could say about it, but in a effort to practice, I have implemented every interview question I've been asked. Some people put pins in butterflies. I collect the questions I have been asked. Also as an exercise as an SDET, there are things that can and should be polished up. Historically speaking this hasn't been subject to the rigor of formal code reviews. The intent is also to serve as a body of work to display and serve as prima facie evidence, since as an SDET, I am doing this for my stuff. I can do this for others in their employ. Plus I have yet to meet another QA professional that does this and it seems like a pretty good differentiator to employers.

# TODO
1) Reimplement in C/ASM
2) Reimplement in Scala
3) Port changes to C# library (yes this exists in C# too)
4) Start that React book, draft up a simple React app and website with suitable scaffolding. Use a Docker container if applicable, or perhaps I can do a super small AWS VM instance? (note to self research that, this sounds like there are more than 1 project dovetailing from this) Make the React and other code exposed and port existing body of work to Javascript. Use mocha or other automation library, port the tests to that framework. (this seems non-trivial in amount of effort, but with the prevelence of Javascript this could be valuable)
